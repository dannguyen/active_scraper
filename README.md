# ActiveScraper


Not really a web-scraping framework. Just want to be able to make HTTP requests and cache and store them in a way that is slightly more object-oriented than a file system.

Currently uses anything compatible with ActiveRecord, but obviously should be using a DocumentStore. Oh well.
